# Welcome to Your New Ethical Hacking Fall 2020 Project!

Your initial project was causing a lot of frustration so I've come up with an alterrnative.  Our goal is to

 1. Encourage self-guided learning
 2. Broaden your skillset to include beneficial future tools
 3. Bring you into open source and security communities
 4. Foster some healthy competition

You will learn:

 - Git
 - Github.com
 - Linux shell/hacking
 - Cryptographic concepts
 - Application Security

You will also be competing!  Rules of engagement:

 - You MAY use outside resources and tools
 - You MAY NOT use outside solutions to the specific wargame tasks.  Yes, I will probably know, and yes your total class grade will be decimated.  
 - You MAY converse with your class about this project on the D2L message board "Wargame Discussion" in generics, and linking to help... don't share solutions.
 - You MAY NOT discuss the project through any other channel or medium (text, whatsapp, Slack, Teams, email, in-person -- ALL are prohibited)
 - You MAY NOT work as a team

Project Assignment (i.e. bare minimum to get a 100)
The setup (mandatory -- i.e. **nothing else is graded without this**). There are no limitations to using outside sources on the setup phase.  Complete this as soon as possible so we can start tracking the scoreboard: 
 - [ ] Sign up for WeChall, connected to overthewire.org . Guide is here: https://overthewire.org/information/wechall.html
 - [ ] Add overthewire.org as a linked site in wechall here https://www.wechall.net/linked_sites
 - [ ] Make a pull request to this page, updating the table below with your initials, overthewire name, and wechall name.  More info here https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request . Or you could take the easy way out by clicking the "README.MD" file above, clicking the pencil "edit this file in your fork" button, add your name, then click "propose changes"
 - [ ] Go to the D2L forum "Wargames Mapping" and post your wechall username and your overthewire username

Shell hacking (25%). Looking up a Linux command or conceptual help is fine.  Looking up **answers** = integrity violation.   Just don't do it.  Looking up a Linux command is fine.  Source **everything**   :

 - [ ] Complete all 33 sections of the Bandit CTF game here: https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/
 - [ ] SUBMIT YOUR SCORE IN EACH LEVEL.  10 points will be deducted for failing to do this.
 - [ ] For EACH of the 33 sections, take a screenshot of the page when you find the solution for each level.  Put all of these screenshots in a single Word document, in order named "1-shell_hacking.docx".  Submitting them loose or as a zipped up archive, or in any other manner will result in a 20 point deduction.

Cryptography (25%).  Same rules as Shell hacking.  Looking up a Linux command or conceptual help is fine.  Looking up **answers** = integrity violation.  Source **everything**   :
 - [ ] Complete all 7 sections of the Krypton CTF game here: https://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/
 - [ ] SUBMIT YOUR SCORE IN EACH LEVEL.  10 points will be deducted for failing to do this.
 - [ ] For EACH of the 7 sections, take a screenshot of the page when you find the solution for each level.  Put all of these screenshots in a single Word document, in order named "2-cryptography.docx".  Submitting them loose or as a zipped up archive, or in any other manner will result in a 20 point deduction.

Web Security (25%).  Looking up a Linux command or conceptual help is fine.  Looking up **answers** = integrity violation. Source **everything**   :
 - [ ] Complete all 34 sections of the Natas CTF game here: https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/
 - [ ] SUBMIT YOUR SCORE IN EACH LEVEL.  10 points will be deducted for failing to do this.
 - [ ] For EACH of the 34 sections, take a screenshot of the page when you find the solution for each level.  Put all of these screenshots in a single Word document, in order named "3-web_security.docx".  Submitting them loose or as a zipped up archive, or in any other manner will result in a 20 point deduction.

Free Form: (25%).  Looking up a Linux command or conceptual help is fine.  Looking up **answers** = integrity violation.   Source **everything**   :

 - [ ] Completing the three prior assignments should have you at 74 "solved" puzzles shown on your profile in wechall here https://www.wechall.net/linked_sites.  You must have a total of OVER 100 "solved" from overthewire.org (it should also show as 57%+ completion percent).  You may choose whatever CTF games on overthewire you'd like, but you must solve a total of 100 or more -- note you must finish the full puzzle (i.e. if there are 7 levels to a game, you need to finish all 7.  Don't just complete the first few levels of each game).
 - [ ]  SUBMIT YOUR SCORE IN EACH LEVEL.  10 points will be deducted for failing to do this.
 - [ ] For EACH of the levels, take a screenshot of the page when you find the solution for each level.  Put all of these screenshots in a single Word document named after the game, in order, named "<4>-<game_name>.docx".  Submitting them loose or as a zipped up archive, or in any other manner will result in a 20 point deduction.

Finishing: Create a file named "0-completion.docx" that contains a list of all the overthewire.org challenges you completed, as well as your final wechall user name and overall score.

EXTRA CREDIT: Win Scenario based on total SCORE on wechall.  It doesn't matter which sites you use, the only thing that matters will be the final score.

1st Place: 5% to final grade

2nd Place: 4% to final grade

3rd Place: 3% to final grade

4-10: +10 points on final exam

11-20: +5 points on final exam
